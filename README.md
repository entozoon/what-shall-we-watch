# What Shall We Watch? (WIP)

Keep a list of movies to help you choose what to watch.

NOTE: This is very much a work-in-progress. I can't for the life of me decide whether or not I want to build it as a [node/nosql server](https://github.com/entozoon/what-shall-we-watch/), an [electron/firebase app](https://github.com/entozoon/lists-of-valour) or [something in between](https://github.com/entozoon/movies-of-valour).. so I'm exhaustively pursuing all avenues, learning loads as I go!

## Install

    git clone https://github.com/entozoon/what-shall-we-watch.git
    npm install

## Run

    npm start
